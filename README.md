# Helmsman

> *Guiding developers from idea to launch — one structured stage at a time.*

Helmsman is a **Claude Code-native plugin** that turns your workflow into a structured, agent-driven SDLC. You bring a PRD (or a bug report, or a vague idea). Helmsman guides you — through discovery, design, implementation, and review — producing not just code, but a complete **dossier** of artifacts that any developer can read to understand the why, what, and how.

**Version 1.4.0** — Feature-complete. All seven pipeline modes, quality gates, lifecycle hooks, skill marketplace, and performance-tuned context loading.

---

## What It Does

```
You:         /start-project payments-v2 --mode feature
Helmsman:    Launches PRD Reviewer → produces clean PRD, assumptions, risks
You:         Review, comment, /approve
Helmsman:    Launches Researcher → codebase findings, stakeholder map, prior art
You:         /approve
Helmsman:    Launches Architect → tech design, alternatives, ADRs
You:         "I prefer approach B" → /approve
Helmsman:    Breaks work into atomic tasks
You:         /approve
Helmsman:    Implements task by task, each with a self-review pass
You:         Review each task, /approve
Helmsman:    Compiles dossier → projects/payments-v2/dossier.md
```

Each stage is gated: nothing advances until you approve. Every decision is logged. The final dossier is readable by future maintainers.

## Install

### Prerequisites

- Claude Code ≥ 1.0.0
- A directory to use as your Helmsman workspace (sibling to your repos)
- bash ≥ 3.2 (for lifecycle hooks — optional but recommended)

### Option A — From source (recommended)

```bash
# 1. Clone the plugin
git clone https://github.com/helmsman-contributors/helmsman ~/helmsman-plugin

# 2. Register it as a local marketplace in Claude Code
/plugin marketplace add ~/helmsman-plugin

# 3. Install the plugin
/plugin install helmsman
```

### Option B — Development / local path

```
/plugin marketplace add /path/to/helmsman
/plugin install helmsman
```

Or load for a single session without installing:

```bash
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/helmsman
```

### First-Run Setup

```
/helmsman-init
```

The wizard:
1. Creates your workspace directory with `manifest.yaml`, `memory/`, `projects/`, `templates/`
2. Registers your first repository
3. Optionally installs lifecycle hooks (`inject-state`, `pre-push-guard`, `stop-log`)
4. Optionally imports existing `CLAUDE.md` content as initial memory

> **Tip:** If commands don't appear after install, run `/reload-plugins`.

---

## Updating

```bash
cd ~/helmsman-plugin && git pull
```

Then in Claude Code: `/reload-plugins`

## Quickstart

```
# Start a project in any mode
/start-project my-feature --mode feature
/start-project login-crash --mode bugfix
/start-project redis-oom  --mode hotfix
/start-project ws-spike   --mode spike

# Core workflow
/status          # where you are — rich pipeline view
/approve         # accept current stage artifacts
/advance         # run gates, start next stage's agent
/comment "..."   # request changes without advancing

# Navigation
/projects        # dashboard of all projects (one line each)
/projects --blocked   # only projects needing attention

# Gate control
/override-gate has_adrs --stage 04-tech-design --severity hard --reason "team policy"
/override-gate has_2_alternatives --stage 04-tech-design --bypass --reason "trivial change"
/override-gate --list

# Recovery
/jump-back 02-prd-clean --reason "changed auth approach"
/propagate       # re-run stale downstream stages
/snapshots       # view/restore snapshots

# Completion
/dossier         # compile final artifact record
/distill-memory  # extract learnings to team memory
```

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| **Stage** | One phase of the SDLC (PRD Review, Discovery, Tech Design, etc.) |
| **Agent** | Specialist sub-agent that does the work for a stage |
| **Skill** | Instructions + templates the agent loads for a stage |
| **Gate** | Quality check that must pass before advancing (hard = block, soft = warn) |
| **Dossier** | Final compiled artifact: the complete readable record of a project |
| **state.yaml** | Source of truth for a project's current stage, gates, and history |
| **manifest.yaml** | Workspace registry of repos and global defaults |
| **gate_config** | Per-project gate severity overrides (strict / balanced / lenient) |
| **Skill override** | Workspace-local file that augments or replaces a plugin skill |
| **Community skill** | Third-party skill extending Helmsman without modifying the plugin |

| Command | Description |

| `/helmsman-init` | First-run workspace setup wizard |
| `/start-project <name>` | Start a new project (prompts for PRD) |
| `/status [project]` | Full pipeline view; `--gates`, `--history`, `--overrides` flags |
| `/projects` | One-line dashboard of all projects; `--blocked`, `--mode` filters |
| `/advance` | Run gate check and invoke next stage's agent |
| `/approve` | Accept current stage artifacts |

---

## Quality Gates

Gates enforce quality before advancing. Each gate has a severity:

- **hard** — blocks `/advance` until resolved (or bypassed with reason)
- **soft** — warns but allows advance
- **skip** — omitted entirely (set via `/override-gate`)

Project-level strictness can be changed: `strict` (all soft→hard), `balanced` (default), `lenient` (all hard→soft).

See [docs/SCHEMAS.md](docs/SCHEMAS.md) for the full gate ID catalog.

---

## Lifecycle Hooks

Three hooks wire Helmsman into Claude Code's session lifecycle:

| Hook | Event | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `inject-state` | UserPromptSubmit | Injects active project status as context; shows welcome banner at session start |
| `pre-push-guard` | PreToolUse (Bash) | Blocks `git push` until pre-launch stage is approved |
| `stop-log` | Stop | Appends session-end marker to `decisions.log.md` |

Install during `/helmsman-init` or see [docs/HOOKS.md](docs/HOOKS.md).

---

## Skill Marketplace

Customize or extend any skill without touching the plugin:

- **Override** — put `.claude/skills/<skill>/override.md` in your workspace to augment, replace, or patch a built-in skill
- **Community skills** — drop a full skill in `community-skills/<name>/` and reference it with `skill: community/<name>` in your project
- **Publish** — share skills as a git repo (naming: `helmsman-skills-<theme>`)

See [docs/SKILL_MARKETPLACE.md](docs/SKILL_MARKETPLACE.md).

---

## Performance

Helmsman's context loading is tuned to minimize token usage:

- Sub-agents receive trimmed `state.yaml` (current stage only, not full history)
- `decisions.log.md` is passed as last-5-entries only
- `design.md` is passed as headings-only to Stage 06+
- Read-only commands skip artifact loading entirely
- `history[]` is lazily archived after 25 entries

See [docs/PERFORMANCE.md](docs/PERFORMANCE.md) for the full audit.
